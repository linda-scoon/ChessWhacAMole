 * Calculating allowable moves on the chess board requires converting letters/columns to ASCII. Explanation below...
 *
 * Firstly, a chess board is an 8x8 board, typically denoted with rows being numbered from 1 to 8, and columns labelled under letters from a to h.
 * To move a piece on the board, we would denote the name of the piece and where it is moving to. King to e5, for example.
 *
 * Now onto ASCII...
 *
 * In ASCII, a pawn moving two spaces forward from a2 to a4 would be a pawn moving from column 97 of row 2, to column 97 of row 4. The ASCII for a = 97, and we add 2 spaces to the original row of 2.
 * So, 2 + 2 = 4. Pawn from a2 to a4.
 * We are only adding/subtracting from the second part of the chess piece coordinates, which is a numeric character.
 *
 * That is nice and easy!
 *
 * However! If we were to instead move a rook from a1 to b1, would have to calculate the difference between a and b...
 * So, we instead use convert this to ASCII which represents the characters 'a' and 'b' as numbers!
 *
 * In fact, we can use ASCII to convert all of the 8 characters on a chessboard, from a to h. How exciting!
 *
 * Converting to ASCII, the numbers to denote the letters - consecutively - from a to h is from 97 to 104. See below for explanation...
 *
 * a = 97
 * b = 98
 * c = 99
 * d = 100
 * e = 101
 * f = 102
 * g = 103
 * h = 104!! Yay!
 *
 * Using this, we can now figure out how to move our rook from a1 to b1.
 *
 * The conversation for a1 would be a = column "97" (in ASCII) and the row is 1. b1 would be column "98" and the row would stay as 1.
 * In order to move the rook from a1 to b1, we could add 1 to 97, to get 98 - which is b1! Yay!
 *
 * Now, you should understand most of the program once you have that logic down. Ur welcome.
